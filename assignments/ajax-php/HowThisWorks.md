#How this program works

1. Copy the Files:
Place livesearch.html, ajax.js, and search.php into one directory on PHP liveserver.

2. Access the Page:
Open livesearch.html in your browser. As you type a state name (or part of it), the page will use AJAX to request matching capitols from search.php and display them dynamically.

3. Test Examples (From Canvas):

Typing “S” should show “Columbia, Pierre” (since South Carolina and South Dakota start with S).
Typing “South” will filter down to the same two results.
